Thank you for showing interest in improving the server. When submitting a suggestion, be as detailed as possible and include your reasoning for it. You can also include pictures and external links.

Your suggestion will be sent to the Admins and Mods where it will be reviewed. Submitting a suggestion does not mean that it is guaranteed to be implemented because a suggestion is "an idea or plan put forward for consideration".

If you want to discuss your suggestion with others, feel free to talk about it in the `#general-dnd` or `#general-off-topic` channels on the server.

Lastly, your suggestion will be ignored if it involves any of the following things:
• RP chats.
• Anything homebrew for player characters and magic items.
• Forcing DMs to use a universal time zone.
• Any kind of respecing past Level 4.
• Trading/selling magic items.
• Downtime.
