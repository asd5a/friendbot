In order to help determine if the adventurers fulfilled a pillar or a guild's quest guidelines, answer the following questions:

**Exploration**
• Did they deal with environmental effects? How did they resolve them?
• Did they interact the environment to gather info and make informed decisions? What were the clues? How did these contribute to their success?
• Did they travel or solve a puzzle/trap within a limited time frame? What problems did they have to face? How were they solved?
• How did any unsuccessful attempts negatively affect future events?

**Social**
• Did they change an NPC's attitude? How did they do it and why was it important?
• Did they convince an NPC of something against their nature or traits? Why was it important?
• Did they retrieve info from an NPC? How did they retrieve it? How was it relevant to the main objective?
• How did any unsuccessful attempts negatively affect future events?

**Combat**
• Did they fight? What kind of creatures and why? How did these encounters relate to the main objective?
• Did they engage in combat as a result of unsuccessful attempts in the Exploration or Social pillars?
• Did combat present complications for future events?

**Guilds**
• How were guilds central to plot and setting, main objectives, core elements, and overall progression of your one-shot?
• Which guidelines were fulfilled and how?
• If guidelines were not fulfilled, how/why did the party fail?
